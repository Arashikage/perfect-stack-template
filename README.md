# Template for the Perfect Stack

To make it possible to gather data from all perfect stacks created during the Knowabunga day and to "formalize" the outcome for each team. You'll need to create 2 files in the root of the repository.

## perfect-stack.json
This is npm inspired file to make it possible to parse and gather data from all stacks.

If you would like to add a field, please do, but also add the field to the perfect-stack.json so that we don't end up with 5 different fields to include an image of your own personal unicorn.

## perfect-stack.md
This is the read me for the stack.

In this file you'll have the possibility to reflect and express how you feel about the stack that has been created during the knowabunga day.

It will also act as an entry point for someone interested in your stack.

If someone is interested in gathering data from all stacks it should be possible to parse the perfect-stack.md to display information about the stack when it has been selected.
